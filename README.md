# Auth0 Navigator Tutorial

## Development

  ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:auth0/tutorial-navigator.git
    cd navigator-tutorial
    make dev-run
  ```

  And then point your browser at `http://localhost:8989/example.html`

  **Warning!**: At this point, for this to look "good" it requires [auth0/styleguide](https://github.com/auth0/styleguide) to be includuded in the site where it displays.
  > this **will** be fixed soon
