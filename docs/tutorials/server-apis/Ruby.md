##NodeJS

If you're creating a new NodeJS api that you'll use with your <%= configuration.frontend %> code, you can [click here to download](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-nodejsapi-sample/archive/master.zip) a seed project that is already configured to use Auth0.

Then, you just need to specify your configuration in the `.env` file: https://github.com/auth0/auth0-nodejsapi-sample#running-the-example

Otherwise, Please follow the steps below to configure NodeJS to use it with Auth0.

### 1. Add express-jwt dependency

You need to add the express-jwt dependency.

Just run the following code to install the dependency and add it to your `package.json`

````js
npm install express-jwt --save
````

### 2. Configure express-jwt with your Auth0 account

You need to set the ClientID and ClientSecret in `express-jwt`'s configuration so that it can validate and sign [JWT](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt)s for you.

````js
  var http = require('http');
  var express = require('express');
  var app = express();
  var jwt = require('express-jwt');

  var authenticate = jwt({
    secret: new Buffer('<%= account.clientSecret %>', 'base64'),
    audience: '<%= account.clientId %>'
  });
````

### 3. Secure your API

Now, you need to specify one or more routes or paths that you want to protect, so that only users with the correct JWT will be able to do the request.

app.configure(function () {

  // ...

  app.use('/api/path-you-want-to-protect', authenticate);

  // ...

});

### 4. You've nailed it.

Now you have both your FrontEnd and Backend configured to use Auth0. Congrats, you're awesome!
